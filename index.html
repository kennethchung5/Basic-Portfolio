                <p id="firstPara" class="abtMe">Hi, I'm Kenneth. I currently work in e-discovery/litigation support, but I'm an aspiring web developer. You're looking at my first (somewhat) serious attempt at a portfolio. I've written or adapted a few highly-specialized scripts at work, but I haven't had any formal education in coding until now. I'm hoping that my background in math has equipped me with the analytical skills and rigor needed to become a successful web developer.</p>
                <p class="clear abtMe">One of the many reasons coding appeals to me is that it enables us to perform tasks that are otherwise tedious and error-prone, perhaps even impossible; by enlisting the capabilities of machines, we can devise efficient and reliable solutions to complex problems. This theme of empowering people to address life's challenges is one that I've noticed in many of my other interests as well: education, Secular Humanism, and mental health, for example. In my increasingly-elusive free time, I also enjoy volunteering, playing the piano, and playing softball decently.</p>
